# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Daniella Michel**

**Wordle** is an app that This iOS app is a Swift-based clone of the popular word puzzle game Wordle. Players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word within six tries. After each guess, the app provides visual feedback using colored tiles:

ðŸŸ© Green indicates the letter is correct and in the correct position.

ðŸŸ¨ Yellow means the letter is correct but in the wrong position.

â¬› Gray shows the letter is not in the word.

The app uses UIKit for its interface, with custom UICollectionViewCells to display each letter. It features animated transitions, tap gesture handling, and dynamic styling based on guess accuracy. The game logic is modular, and the word list is randomly generated for each session. This project is ideal for learning Swift fundamentals, enum-driven UI updates, and asset catalog management in Xcode. [TODO]
